|Special String Again|
\====================/

A string is said to be a special string if either of two conditions is met:

All of the characters are the same, e.g. aaa.
All characters except the middle one are the same, e.g. aadaa.
A special substring is any substring of a string which meets one of those criteria. Given a string, determine how many special substrings can be formed from it.

For example, given the string s = mnonopoo, we have the following special substrings:
{m, n, o, n, o, p, o, o, non, ono, opo, oo}.

Function Description

Complete the substrCount function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of special substrings that can be formed from the given string.

substrCount has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer, the length of string s
s: a string

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, the length of s.
The second line contains the string s.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^6
Each character of the string is a lowercase alphabet, ascii[a-z].

Output Format

Print a single line containing the count of total special substrings.

Sample Input 0

5
asasd

Sample Output 0

7 

Explanation 0

The special palindromic substrings of s = {asasd} are {a, s, a, s, d, asa, sas}

Sample Input 1

7
abcbaba

Sample Output 1

10

Explanation 1

The special palindromic substrings of s = abcbaba are {a, b, c, b, a, b, a, bcb, bab, aba}

Sample Input 2

4
aaaa

Sample Output 2

10

Explanation 2

The special palindromic substrings of s = {a, a, a, a} are {a, a, a, a, aa, aa, aa, aaa, aaa, aaaa}

|Explanation|
\===========/

This tricky problem can be solved with one iteration through the string.
Test each character by moving forward one char at a time. Every repeating character creates another palindrome.
When a new character is reached, test to see if the next x chars are the same as the original repeating char.
To save time, we can also check to ensure the amount of required chars after the center character can fit in the remaining space of the char.
